## Background
About project  
Creating models that predict dividend changes for the upcoming year. These models will enable users to input a stock ticker and receive a forecast of how the dividends for that stock are expected to change over the next year. By leveraging these models, our clients can make more informed investment decisions and better manage their portfolios. The primary goal is to provide accurate and actionable insights into future dividend trends, enhancing the financial planning and strategy development for our clients.
